## Tech Stack

**Client:** Nuxt2, Vuetify2, Vuex

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB


## Lessons Learned

I improved my Nuxt2 working skills, working on forms, validation, conditional component rendering, working with Vuetify and Nuxt's built-in animations. The real challenge was configuring the API and database in MongoDB. Based on what I have created it will be easier to deploy to future projects.
